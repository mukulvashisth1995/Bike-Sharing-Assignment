## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider `BoomBikes` has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.
- The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands



## Conclusions
- Identified factors which can trigger a loan applicant which is likely to be charged off without compromising on good applications. A few mentioned below:
- Borrowers having longer term for repayment showed high tendencies to default
- Income verified people also present higher default rate, so some new measures need to be implemented while verifying to access the financial stability of borrower
- Club assigns some grades to the borrowers. From their classification, a few groups with grades A, B, C came out highly profitable and others not so much
- Sub-Grades are also introduced to have more insights before makinf decisions
- Impact of owning their residence is analyzed. And people renting their houses are found more likely to default
- The maximum loans apporved were between range 5k-15k. So the approval rate is high within this window
- Employment length found to be deceiving as it really had no pattern with regards to repayment prediction.
